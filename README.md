#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of designing, testing, and maintaining software systems. It involves applying engineering principles and techniques to develop, test, and deliver software.

Software engineering is important in the technology industry because it helps to ensure that software systems are
 -reliable : where software works as expected.
 -efficient : where software uses resources effectively.
 -scalable : where software can handle increased load.
 -flexable : where software can adapt to changing requirements.
 -secure : where software protects user data.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The creation of OOP programming which reduce complexity of software systems being developed.

2.  The introduction of the Agile Method which allows for efficient process in developing systems as it allowed for continous improvements and collaboration.

3.  The  recognition of software development as a distinct field, separate from hardware engineering, and highlighted the need for formal, systematic approaches to software development. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning: Defining project scope, what you are building and why are you building it.
Requirement Analysis: Understand what the end user specifications are.
Design: Creating a detailed plan of how the software will be built. e.x creating interfaces.
Implementation: Writing the code as per specifications to meet requirements. 
Testing: Making sure that the program works by ensuring that there is no bugs and that it meets the requirements.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall:
Process of developing stystems is done step by step where each phase is completed first before moving to another that allows for more structure and predictability.
Example:  Building a customized banking system for a bank where all features and regulations are already defined. Since banking software requires strict security and regulation, it's best to follow a structured approach to ensure all requirements are met from the start.

Agile:
Process of developing systems is done in an iterative manner where project gets broken down into smaller managable task that allow for easy changes and continuous improvement.
Example: Developing a mobile app for a new e-commerce platform. Since the market and user needs can change rapidly, Agile allows the developer to iterate on new features, release updates often, and respond quickly to user feedback, making sure the product stays relevant.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Create the products / systems required. They also must check for bugs and fix them.

Quality Assurance Engineer: Makes sure that the product works on multiple environments. 

Project Manager: Gets requirements from the clients and establishes up whether the requirements are feasible or not. Also makes sure that the project is completed on time and meets expectation


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs:
Helps developers to write, run, and debug code in one place. They combine various development tools into one application, making it easier for developers to work on their projects efficiently.

VCS: Are essential tools for managing code changes, especially when multiple developers are working on a project. They help track different versions of the software, collaborate with teams, and ensure that code changes are safely managed.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Fixing Bugs: It is very common for software engineers to encounter bugs in their code. Strategies to overcome this include: use IDEs to that come with built in debuggers that help with identifying bugs, use testing frameworks to test the code before it is deployed, and use version control systems.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit: Testing one component of the system.

intergration: Testing how different parts of the system work together. This step checks if multiple components, which might have been tested individually, work well when combined.

system: Testing the entire system to ensure that it works as expected.

acceptance: Testing to ensure that the system meets the requirements of the end user and is ready for deployment. This is often the final step before the software is released.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

 Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing and refining the input prompts that are given to an AI model (like ChatGPT) to get the best, most relevant, or most accurate responses.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague prompt: "Explain machine learning"

clear,specific and concise: "How does supervised learning differ from unsupervised learning in machine learning?"
